# What Is Strategy? by Michael E. Porter

## The Idea in Brief
- *operational effectiveness* - performing activities better—that is, faster, or with fewer inputs and defects—than rivals
- *productivity frontier* - the maximum value a company can deliver at a given cost, given the best available technology, skills, and management techniques
- *competitive convergence* - the more indistinguishable companies are from one another
- *strategic positioning* - performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways

## The Idea at Work
- strategic positioning principles
  1. strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities
     - serving few needs of many customers (Jiffy Lube provides only auto lubricants)
     - serving broad needs of few customers (Bessemer Trust targets only very high-wealth clients)
     - serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market (Carmike Cinemas operates only in cities with a population under 200,000)
  2. strategy requires you to make trade-offs in competing—to choose what not to do
  3. strategy involves creating “fit” among a company’s activities
- employees need guidance about how to deepen a strategic position rather than broaden or compromise it

## Positioning
- a company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve
- the essence of strategy is choosing to perform activities differently than rivals do
- positioning can be based on:
  1. *variety-based positioning* - producing a subset of an industry’s products or services
  2. *needs-based positioning* - serving most or all the needs of a particular group of customers
  3. *access-based positioning* - segmenting customers who are accessible in different ways
- if there were only one ideal position, there would be no need for strategy

### Trade-offs
- trade-offs arise for three reasons:
  1. inconsistencies in image or reputation
  2. activities themselves (inflexibilities in machinery, people, or systems)
  3. limits on internal coordination and control
- Trade-offs are essential to strategy. They create the need for choice and purposefully limit what a company offers
- The essence of strategy is choosing what *not* to do

### Fit
- three types of fit:
  1. First-order fit is simple consistency between each activity (function) and the overall strategy
  2. Second-order fit occurs when activities are reinforcing
  3. Third-order fit goes beyond activity reinforcement to what I call optimization of effort
