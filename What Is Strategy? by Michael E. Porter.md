# What Is Strategy? by Michael E. Porter

## The Idea in Brief
- *operational effectiveness* - performing activities better—that is, faster, or with fewer inputs and defects—than rivals
- *productivity frontier* - the maximum value a company can deliver at a given cost, given the best available technology, skills, and management techniques
- *competitive convergence* - the more indistinguishable companies are from one another
- *strategic positioning* - performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways

## The Idea at Work
- strategic positioning principles
  1. strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities
     - serving few needs of many customers (Jiffy Lube provides only auto lubricants)
     - serving broad needs of few customers (Bessemer Trust targets only very high-wealth clients)
     - serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market (Carmike Cinemas operates only in cities with a population under 200,000)
  2. strategy requires you to make trade-offs in competing—to choose what not to do
  3. strategy involves creating “fit” among a company’s activities
- employees need guidance about how to deepen a strategic position rather than broaden or compromise it

## Positioning
- a company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve
- the essence of strategy is choosing to perform activities differently than rivals do
- positioning can be based on:
  1. *variety-based positioning* - producing a subset of an industry’s products or services
  2. *needs-based positioning* - serving most or all the needs of a particular group of customers
  3. *access-based positioning* - segmenting customers who are accessible in different ways
- if there were only one ideal position, there would be no need for strategy

## Trade-offs
- trade-offs arise for three reasons:
  1. inconsistencies in image or reputation
  2. activities themselves (inflexibilities in machinery, people, or systems)
  3. limits on internal coordination and control
- Trade-offs are essential to strategy. They create the need for choice and purposefully limit what a company offers
- The essence of strategy is choosing what *not* to do

## Fit
- three types of fit:
  1. First-order fit is simple consistency between each activity (function) and the overall strategy
  2. Second-order fit occurs when activities are reinforcing
  3. Third-order fit goes beyond activity reinforcement to what I call optimization of effort
- It is harder for a rival to match an array of interlocked activities than it is merely to imitate a particular sales-force approach, match a process technology, or replicate a set of product features. Positions built on systems of activities are far more sustainable than those built on individual activities
- Strategic positions should have a horizon of a decade or more, not of a single planning cycle
- Strategy is creating fit among a company’s activities

## Reconnecting with Strategy
- help a company recon- nect with strategy:
  1. Which of our product or service varieties are the most distinctive?
  2. Which of our product or service varieties are the most profitable?
  3. Which of our customers are the most satisfied?
  4. Which customers, channels, or purchase occasions are the most profitable?
  5. Which of the activities in our value chain are the most different and effective?
- At general management’s core is strategy: defining a company’s position, making trade-offs, and forging fit among activities
- The leader must provide the discipline to decide which industry changes and customer needs the company will respond to, while avoiding organizational distractions and maintaining the company’s distinctiveness
- One of the leader’s jobs is to teach others in the organization about strategy – and to say no
