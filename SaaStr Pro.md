## So what am I hoping that each of us gets out of SaaStr Pro?

1. Understand the key dynamics and best practices of SaaS companies at our stage related to your primary discipline, so that you learn what the best of the best are doing and can translate that into action at Tourbuzz.
2. Understand what is important for SaaS companies at our stage in general, so that you can better understand why we are prioritizing the things you see across the company.
3. Identify specific, actionable opportunities for you or your team to take risks at doing things a different way, and being confident enough to try it.
