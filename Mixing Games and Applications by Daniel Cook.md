# Mixing Games and Applications by Daniel Cook

- Games provide small challenges with subtle hints. Users achieve the aha moment (dopamine rush) and feel self accomplished. This is why games are fun, the aha and sense of accomplishment.

## Exploratory Learning
- STARS (skills atom or STARS atom)
    - Skills
    - Tools & Actions
    - Rules
    - Stimulus

## Patterns
- Levels
    - New tool paired with safe environment (level) to learn it
    - Passing the level requires skill acquisition (gating)
        - Later levels can then rely on previous skill acquisition 

    * Make the equivalent of a ‘level’ or learning context to help you build skills with the tool.
    * Don't make the user "grind" (next, next, next buttons to get the popup out of their face)

- Items
    - Modular so the tool's existence doesn't make or break the app (but having it empowers the user)
    - Paired with levels to learn the skill(s) associated with the item

    * Let user master one before offering the next
    * Introduce advanced skills through item acquisition

- Inventory
    - Long Term
    - Short Term
    - Item Acquisition

    * Needed for task at hand are easily accessible

- Quests (aka explicit goals)
    - By explicitly explicitly offering offering the goal, you alert the player that something is possible.
    - The goal gives them something to measure their incremental progress towards.  
    - We are bred to complete activities. If we don’t, our brains end up churning away on them...
    - Finishing a cognitive loop so that it can be packaged away as a nice neat mental model again gives a distinct feeling of relief and pleasure.

    * Be explicit about the reason (How does this get me closer to the bigger goal)

- Score (aka user facing metrics)
    - In exploratory learning a simple number reflects positive or negative progress toward a goal

    * Tie metrics to progress through the skill atoms and you’ll see learning rates soar

- Advancement/Elder Game
    - The app you end up using is not the app you start with
    - Skills
        - Pre-existing (intuitive aspect)
        - Reward (attained through STARS atoms)
            -  The designer adds explicit reward/punishment metrics to guide the player's skill understanding
        - Emergent (emerge from pre-existing and reward)
    - Elder Game (emergent skills through minimal mediation)
    - Advancement Game (learning basics through heavier mediation)

## Summary

- Be intentional about what the goals are, when to introduce functionality, and to empower users through emergent skill acquisition.
