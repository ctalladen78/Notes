## Chemistry basics

- *matter* - anything having mass that occupies space
  - all matter is composed of atoms
- *atom* - a composition of particles (unit building block of matter)
  - *particle* - portion of matter with a positive, negative, or neutral electric charge
    - *proton* - positive electrically charged particle
    - *neutron* - neutral electrically charged particle
    - *electron* - negative electrically charged particle
  - atoms with a distinct proton count are of a particular type
    - *neutral* - a particular atom type of equal proton and electron count (normal)
    - *isotope* - a particular atom type where neutron count varies (version)
    - *ion* - a particular atom type where electron count varies (charge)
  - anatomy
    - *nucleus* - proton and neutron cluster
    - *shell* - electron orbit of nucleus
      - *valence shell* - outermost electron shell
- *element* - substance composed of a particular type of atom
- *molecule* - composition of two or more atoms (not necessarily different atom types)
- *compound* - composition of two or more elements (two distinct element types)
- common bonds
  - *ionic* - bonds between metals and non-metals (tranferred electrons)
  - *covalent* - bonds between non-metals (shared electrons)
- *periodic table of elements* 
  - the atomic number of each element defines its atom's proton/electron count
  - row - each of seven rows defines the electron shell count for each element in the row where the amount of elements in each row signifies each shell's maximum electron capacity
  - column - grouping/family of elements sharing similar physical or chemical characteristics of the valance shell
