# What Is Strategy? - by Michael E. Porter

## The Idea in Brief
- operational effectiveness - perform- ing these activities better—that is, faster, or with fewer inputs and defects—than rivals
- productivity frontier - the maximum value a company can deliver at a given cost, given the best available technology, skills, and management techniques
- competitive convergence - the more indistinguishable companies are from one another
- strategic positioning - performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways

## The Idea at Work
- strategic positioning principles
  1. strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities
    - serving few needs of many customers (Jiffy Lube provides only auto lubricants)
    - serving broad needs of few customers (Bessemer Trust targets only very high-wealth clients)
    - serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market (Carmike Cinemas operates only in cities with a population under 200,000)
  2. strategy requires you to make trade-offs in competing—to choose what not to do
  3. strategy involves creating “fit” among a company’s activities
- employees need guidance about how to deepen a strategic position rather than broaden or compromise it
