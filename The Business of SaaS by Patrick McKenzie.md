## SaaS Models

### Low-touch

- designed for customer majority with minimal one-on-one interaction
- primary sales channels are:
    - website
    - email marketing
    - free trial (very low friction onboard)
        - Customer Success teams are less focused on convincing people and more on ensuring successful onboarding and conversion
- example business:
    - Basecamp
    - Atlassian

### High-touch

- designed for heavy sales team focus where convincing plays a larger role in adoption
- specialized roles include:
  - marketing generates qualified leads for sales to evaluate and close
  - SDRs find prospects
  - AEs own the sales processs against particular customers
  - AMs own happiness and performance of an individualized portfolio of accounts
- example business:
    - Salesforce
    
## SaaS Fundamentals

- "one’s revenue, over the long term, is the number of customers times the average lifetime revenue per customer"
    - `#` of customers `=` acquisition `*` conversion rate
    - churn `=` % of customers over a given period who do not continue payment
    - LTV `=` how much $ paid in a particular period and how many periods they persist using the service
        - LTV generally `=` inverse of churn (5% churn/mo means 20mo lifetime @$30/mo means LTV of $600)
- "Price is the easiest lever to improve a SaaS business."
- "SaaS businesses eventually asymptote."
- "Bootstrapped SaaS businesses often take 18 months before they’re profitable enough to be competitive with reasonable wages for the founding team"

## Benchmarks

Conversion rates of low-touch SaaS trials with credit card not required:
- substantially below 1%: generally evidence of poor product-market fit
- ~1%: roughly the baseline for competent execution
- 2%+: extremely good

Conversion rates of low-touch SaaS trials with credit card required:
- substantially below 40%: generally evidence of poor product-market fit
- 40%: roughly the baseline for competent execution
- 60%: doing well!

Churn Rates:
- 2%: a very sticky product, with strong product-market fit and substantial investments in reducing involuntary churn
- 5%: roughly where you expect to start
- 7%: you likely have either low-hanging fruit for preventing voluntary churn or are selling to a difficult market
- 10%+: Evidence of very poor product market fit and an existential threat to the company

Product/market fit - if you have to question if you've found it, you don't have it yet
